# MACD_flask_project
 This project provides trading information to users based on the MACD indicator. The algorithm built provides value by matching the likely signals 'overbought' and 'oversold' to the appropriate MACD crossovers. A quick observation suggests that the results provided are accurate around 60% of the time, better than the stock screeners which does not match the appropriate signals to the right MACD crossovers
